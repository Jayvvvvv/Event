Even simple adjustments, like a change in interest rates, can have profound and lasting effects. Be sure to factor these changes into the market strategy. Being well informed about policy changes is critical for accurate forecasting of market changes.
Competition: Having information about your direct competitors, such as the size of their share of the market, including their sales volume, is a critical factor in determining market potential. It’s also crucial to understand your indirect competitors—companies that provide similar services or products to your current customers and are likely to become direct competitors.
Technology: Technological change affects almost every aspect of the marketplace, from market growth rate to consumer demand. For instance, the shift away from brick and mortar stores to e-commerce was a significant factor in the market potential for various retail industries.
